Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the price of used cars based on key features such as car company, fuel type, year of manufacture, and kilometers driven. 
The prediction model is built using a Linear Regression model, with data preprocessing, feature scaling, and encoding applied to prepare the data for model training.
Let's have a look how i achieved it in Car_Price_Prediction.py file.
